# PMMI.org Technical Architecture Guide

* Layout will be accomplished with Display Suite and custom 
layout templates.
* No other layout tools shall be used.
* Node and Block displays will be configured with Display Suite.
* Panels will be treated as content and used only for custom pages 
that are created and managed by the site editor.
* Panels pages shall use a custom layout template (not the Flexible 
builder).
* Rendered entities shall be displayed whenever possible.
* Views shall show the Rendered Entity and not fields (with rare 
exceptions).
* Panels Everywhere will be used for the site template.
* The Drupal core block layout shall not be used (except for admin 
theme).
* The [Build Specifications](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1d_uSEmtqDVS5_BRUGXWUepLWxPR9SLTMHD4UpCtdqQw/edit#gid=0)
shall serve as the master authority, taking the 
[Style Guide](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B_-kMUlGvQhSem9rdUV5LW9ydnM/view?usp=sharing)
into account.
