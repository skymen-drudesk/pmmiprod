Audience Select
===============

Creates a site gateway page for audience selection, sets a cookie, and 
redirects to homepage. Also provides an Audience context and condition 
for varying display.

Instructions
------------

Unpack in the *modules* folder (currently in the root of your Drupal 8
installation) and enable in `/admin/modules`.

Then, visit `/admin/config/audience_select` and and enter your own set
of audiences.

If you need, there's also a specific *administer audience select* 
permission.
