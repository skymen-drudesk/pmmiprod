<p><strong><strong>Virginia Tech Awarded Mark C. Garvey Scholarship</strong><br /><br /></strong><em>Packaging Systems and Design Student, Marlon Levy-Faigen, to Receive $2,500&#160;</em></p>
<p><strong>Reston, Va.; Dec. 9, 2016</strong> &#8212; The PMMI Foundation along with the Garvey Corporation has selected Virginia Tech as the recipient of this year&#8217;s Mark Garvey Scholarship in the amount of $2,500. PMMI, The Association for Packaging and Processing Technologies, supports packaging education at more than 25 U.S. colleges, universities and technical schools.</p>
<p>&#8220;This was a difficult decision due to the quality of packaging programs at <a href=""http://www.pmmi.org/Education/PartnerSchools.aspx?navItemNumber=31128"">PMMI Partner Schools</a>, but we were pleased to select Virginia Tech as the recipient school of the Mark C. Garvey Scholarship for 2016,&#8221; said Jake Garvey, director of OEM Sales, Garvey Corporation.</p>
<p>The student selected to receive the scholarship, Marlon Levy-Faigen, is a senior at Virginia Tech majoring in Packaging Systems and Design. Not only does he have a 3.56 GPA, he is the president of the IoPP student club and works as a research assistant to graduate students.</p>
<p>&#8220;Marlon took multiple classes with me and his performance was outstanding,&#8221; said Laszlo Horvath, assistant professor and director of the Center for Packaging and Unit Load Design, Virginia Tech. &#8220;He is the type of person who is consistently engaged during class. He demonstrates high-levels of leadership as president of our packaging club which has grown significantly in both size and quality of participation since he became president.&#8221;</p>
<p>PMMI established the Mark C. Garvey scholarship to honor the memory of Mark Garvey, former president and CEO of the <a href=""http://www.garvey.com/"">Garvey Corporation</a>, a past chairman of PMMI and long-time supporter of packaging education. Each fall, the Garvey family awards the scholarship to one PMMI Partner School that demonstrates a commitment to excellence in the packaging industry. The school selects a student to receive the award based on GPA, major, commitment to the&#160;packaging industry, extracurricular involvement and financial need.</p>
<p>Each year, the PMMI Foundation provides $100,000 in scholarships to students majoring in packaging. Students must currently attend a PMMI Partner School to be eligible for PMMI Foundation scholarships.

<p>&#8220;Increasing consumer demand for more healthful foods and beverages continues to fuel the rise of organic, vegetarian and vegan products,&#8221; said Jorge Izquierdo, vice president of Market Development, PMMI. &#8220;Meanwhile, growing demand for convenient, on-the-go and single serve options underscores the need for brand owners to accommodate more active consumer lifestyles.&#8221;</p>
<p>In addition to their own health and wellness, consumers are also showing greater concern for the environmental impact of the supply chain&#8212;particularly, the 1.3 billion tons of food waste representing one-third of food produced for human consumption. Meanwhile, interest in greater packaging sustainability remains strong.</p>
<p>&#8220;Shifting consumer preferences for natural, healthy and Earth-friendly brands place new demands on the manufacturing operations of food and beverage processors,&#8221; Izquierdo said. &#8220;These companies must fine-tune product lines to accommodate new ingredients, implement alternatives to chemical preservatives and often build or modify lines for greater flexibility. Additionally, they must do it all while minimizing changeover times and learning curves for operators.&#8221;</p>
<p>To help food and beverage processors find the solutions they need to adapt their production lines, ProFood Tech will offer a wide range of processing technologies and educational programming. The new, biennial show, powered by three of the world&#8217;s top trade show leaders&#8212;PACK EXPO, Anuga and the International Dairy Foods Association (IDFA)&#8212;ProFood Tech is the only food and beverage focused event in North America that will cover all sectors, including the baking and snack, dairy, frozen foods, prepared foods, meat, poultry and seafood industries. The show will bring together more than 6,000 attendees to view innovations from 400 of the world&#8217;s top food and beverage industry suppliers across more than 150,000 net square feet of exhibit space. Additionally, the ProFood Tech Conference Program presented by IDFA will address market changes, trends and regulations with a 36-session program.</p>
<p>For food and beverage companies based in the eastern United States, <a href=""http://www.packexpoeast.com/"">PACK EXPO East 2017</a> (Feb. 27&#8211;March 1, 2017) will return to the Pennsylvania Convention Center in Philadelphia to serve as the industry&#8217;s premier trade show experience in the region. The show will bring together 400 suppliers of packaging innovations and more than 7,000 attendees from a variety of industries.</p>

With more suppliers and more products coming from different countries, it is critical to identify, capture and share accurate product information.

<p>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE</p>
<h3>Global Anti-Counterfeiting Solutions Growing to Protect Brands and Consumers</h3>
<p><em>With counterfeiting predicted to increase three percent per year worldwide, PACK EXPO East is uniquely positioned to present solutions for brand owners.</em></p>
<p><strong>Reston, Va.; Nov. 29, 2016 &#8212;</strong>&#160;Globalization is creating an increasingly complex, continuously growing supply chain. With more suppliers and more products coming from different countries, it is critical to identify, capture and share accurate product information. In this environment, counterfeiting has become a growing challenge.</p>
<p>According to the 2016 Brand Protection and Product Traceability Market Research report from PMMI, The Association for Packaging and Processing Technologies, counterfeiting is predicted to increase three percent per year worldwide. This rise will lead to increased growth in the anti-counterfeiting market over the next five years with CAGRs ranging from 12.8 to 16 percent. The growth of the global anti-counterfeiting market will outpace the overall combined market segment growth of food, beverage and pharmaceutical industries by roughly two to three times in the next five years.</p>
<p>&#8220;As this trend continues to increase on a global level, it is of paramount importance that all involved in the packaging and processing industry make continued efforts to maintain tracking control in order to prevent counterfeiting and aid in product recall,&#8221; says Paula Feldman, director, Business Intelligence, PMMI. &#8220;With North America alone accounting for fifty percent of the total growth of the global anti-counterfeit food packaging market in 2014, it is increasingly important that we as an industry continue to take the necessary action to protect our brands, as well as those around the globe.&#8221;</p>
<p>PMMI compiled the 2016 Brand Protection and Product Traceability Market Research report from the insights of 75 brand manufacturers, industry experts and technology suppliers who shared their experiences complying with traceability regulations in the food, beverage and pharmaceutical industries.</p>
<p>Brand owners looking for anti-counterfeiting solutions will find them among the 400 exhibitors at&#160;<a name=""PXE"" href=""http://www.packexpoeast.com/"" target=""_blank"">PACK EXPO East 2017</a>, the industry&#8217;s premier trade show experience in the East. Returning to Philadelphia (Feb. 27&#8211;March 1, 2017), the show brings together suppliers of packaging innovations for pharmaceutical/medical device, food, beverage, cosmetic/personal care, chemical/household and other packaged goods, serving companies of all sizes. With one-third of the nation&#8217;s consumer packaged goods companies located within 200 miles of Philadelphia, PACK EXPO East promises to be another top-tier event for the growing industry.</p>

<p><strong>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE</strong></p>
<p><strong><strong>PMMI Releases Newly Revised ANSI/PMMI B155.1-2016 Standard</strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Reston, Va.; Nov. 28, 2016</strong> &#8212; PMMI, The Association for Packaging and Processing Technologies, is pleased to announce the approval of its <em>ANSI/PMMI B155.1-2016 Safety Requirements for Packaging and Processing Machinery </em>standard as an American National Standard by the American National Standards Institute by the Board of Standards Review. The objective of the ANSI/PMMI B155.1-2016 standard is to improve the safety of packaging and processing machinery and eliminate injuries to personnel working on these systems by establishing requirements for the design, construction, reconstruction, modification, installation, set&#8211;up, operation and maintenance of processing and packaging machinery systems.</p>
<p>The ANSI/PMMI B155.1-2016 standard was promulgated by PMMI, an ANSI-accredited standards developing organization, as a voluntary consensus standard to establish safety requirements for machinery. This standard guides processing and packaging machinery suppliers and users through a risk assessment process designed to ensure that reasonably foreseeable hazards are identified and corresponding risks are reduced to an acceptable level.</p>
<p>&#8220;Although engineers have long applied an informal risk assessment framework, the ANSI/PMMI B155.1-2016 standard defines a formal method to conduct and document the risk assessment process,&#8221; said Fred Hayes, director of Technical Services, PMMI. &#8220;PMMI continues to address the safety of packaging, processing and packaging-related converting machinery through its various standards and technical reports.&#8221;</p>
<p>The first version of this standard was approved by the PMMI membership on Sept. 27, 1972. It was approved as an American National Standard by ANSI on Aug. 6, 1973. The standard has been reviewed and revised with subsequent approvals by the ANSI Board of Standards Review in 1979, 1986, 1994, 2000, 2006 and 2011.</p>
<p>The ANSI/PMMI B155.1-2016 standard will be available for purchase through the ANSI webstore at <a href=""http://webstore.ansi.org/"">http://webstore.ansi.org/</a>.</p>

<p><strong>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE</strong></p>
<h3><strong>Largest Ever PACK EXPO Exceeds Highest of Expectations</strong></h3>
<p><em>New records set for exhibitors and total exhibit space.</em></p>
<p><strong>Reston, Va.; Nov. 17, 2016</strong> &#8212; On the 60<sup>th</sup> Anniversary of its debut, PACK EXPO International and the co-located Pharma EXPO served as the world&#8217;s largest and most comprehensive processing and packaging show in 2016.</p>
<p>Show owner and producer PMMI, The Association for Packaging and Processing Technologies, reported that PACK EXPO International and Pharma EXPO 2016 was the largest show in the history of PACK EXPO. A record breaking 2,512 exhibitors spread over an unprecedented 1.25 million net square feet of exhibit space welcomed 46,000 targeted buyers.</p>
<p>&#8220;Exhibitors reported that not only were leads up, but the quality of the attendees continues to grow,&#8221; says Jim Pittas, sr. vice president of PMMI. &#8220;A full audit of the event will be forthcoming, but all initial reports from exhibitors and attendees clearly show PACK EXPO International and Pharma EXPO 2016 was an overwhelming success.&#8221;</p>
<p>Long-time exhibitor and Fortune 500 mainstay Sealed Air, Charlotte, North Carolina, supported the anecdotal evidence, calling 2016 one of its finest PACK EXPO events.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our senior management has been talking this year's show up for months and, with lots of self-driven planning and promotions, it was one of the best we've ever had,&#8221; says Jenn Grubenstetter,&#160;executive director of Global Communications/Product Care for Sealed Air. &#8220;We secured an average of 200 organic leads per day in addition to hosting 350 customers and channel partners for pre-scheduled meetings.""</p>
<p>The buzz on the McCormick Place show floor also confirmed that exhibitors and attendees from companies of all sizes found a rewarding, and some claim unparalleled, experience at the four-day event.</p>
<p>""This PACK EXPO International was our best show yet,&#8221; says Virginia Price,&#160;CEO and founder of exhibitor Planet CanIt, Highland Park, Illinois. &#8220;We are always excited when we have the opportunity to meet manufacturers seeking a high-end packaging solution. At this show, we [saw] top-level executives, marketers and package designers for brands across the food, toy, personal care and other industries we serve.&#8221;</p>
<p>Exhibitors and exhibit space were not the only records broken. In no previous year has PACK EXPO received as many endorsements as this year with the largest ever Partner Program including 31 associations. International pavilion organizers came from all corners of the globe, including Argentina, Bavaria, Brazil, China, France, Germany, Italy, Switzerland and Taiwan.</p>
<p>Long<strong>-</strong>time attendee Preston Jackson, shipping supervisor for LECO Corporation, St. Joseph, Michigan appreciates that a show as large as PACK EXPO offers opportunities for everyone.</p>
<p>""We are a small manufacturing company looking for big ideas and came to the show specifically for sealers for a low-volume project,&#8221; Jackson says. &#8220;Even being a small company we have been able to find solutions at PACK EXPO.""</p>
<p>The education offerings for PACK EXPO were also the largest in the history of the PACK EXPO portfolio of trade shows. The three Innovation Stages at PACK EXPO and one at Pharma EXPO offered free on-floor education, while The Pharma EXPO Conference Program, produced by International Society of Pharmaceutical Engineering, (ISPE) provided three topic tracks covering manufacturing operations, compliance trends and pharmaceutical packaging.</p>
<p>One particularly well-received new addition to PACK EXPO International&#8217;s long list of convenience-enhancing features was the NextGEN Networking Fair, the event that connected both supplier companies and consumer goods manufacturers with student talent in the Education and Workforce Development Pavilion. Fourteen teams of students from 10 partner schools also participated in the Amazing Packaging Race, sponsored by ASCO.

<h3><strong>U.S. Remains Largest Market for Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices</strong></h3>
<p><strong>McCormick Place, Chicago; Nov. 06, 2016 &#8212;</strong>&#160;The U.S. continues to be the largest market for pharmaceutical and medical devices, according to PACK EXPO owner and producer PMMI, The Association for Packaging and Processing Technologies. As the global demand for medicines and devices rise, processors are concerned with issues such as changing consumer demographics, regulatory issues, the need for cost containment, advances in 3D printing and updating legacy lines.</p>
<p>PMMI released the findings of its Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices: Trends and Opportunities in Packaging Operations report at PACK EXPO International and Pharma EXPO 2016.</p>
<p>Looking globally, branded and specialty drugs and innovative medical devices will likely drive spending growth in the developed markets, while an overall increase in the use of pharmaceuticals and medical devices are projected to spur development in emerging markets. Contract manufacturing and packaging for pharmaceutical products in developed markets are forecasted to grow at six percent CAGR through 2018, according to PMMI&#8217;s research. Mergers and acquisitions will also remain a major component of strategic growth, with mergers up 66 percent from 2014 to 2015 and predictions of strong continued activity. Emerging markets, particularly India and China, are seeing rapid growth in pharmaceuticals and medical devices.<br /><br />&#8220;With two out of three companies predicting the need to spend more on capital equipment in the next 12 to 24 months there are great opportunities for OEMs in both pharmaceuticals and medical devices,&#8221; says Jorge Izquierdo, vice president, Market Development, PMMI.&#160;<br /><br />&#8220;Pharmaceutical manufacturers face many of the same opportunities that other packaged goods manufacturers are challenged with, such as sustainability, smart packaging, 3D printing, track &amp; trace and cold chain logistics. The PACK EXPO portfolio of trade shows consistently bring the entire packaging industry together to learn about the latest innovations and advancements benefiting all market sectors,&#8221; Izquierdo adds.</p>
<p>As the report highlights, pharmaceutical manufacturers are subject to some of the most rigorous standards for package printing and labeling. It is critical that pharmaceutical and medical device manufacturers stay abreast of the ever-evolving requirements including necessary counterfeit prevention and security features. Regulations requiring Serialization and Unique Product Identification (UDI) will continue to impact the entire supply chain.</p>
<p>PMMI&#8217;s PACK EXPO portfolio of trade shows continuously brings opportunities for the packaging machinery industry to support and grow the industry.&#160;<a href=""http://www.packexpoeast.com/"">PACK EXPO East 2017</a>, the industry&#8217;s premier trade show experience in the East, returning to Philadelphia (Feb. 27&#8211;Mar. 1, 2017), brings together suppliers of packaging innovations for pharmaceutical/medical device, food, beverage, cosmetic/personal care, chemical/household and other packaged goods that serve companies of all sizes. With one-third of the nation&#8217;s consumer packaged goods companies and the majority of major pharmaceutical manufacturers located within 200 miles of Philadelphia, PMMI is expecting another top-tier event for the growing industry.</p>

<p>The report also notes the value of domestic shipments of U.S.-produced machinery rose 0.3 percent to $7.51 billion in 2015. Exports of packaging machinery in 2015 increased by 3.2 percent, compared to 2014 and are now $1.1B. Backlog orders of packaging machinery grew by 14.1 percent compared to backlog orders at the end of 2014.</p>
<p>PMMI released the findings of its 2016 State of the Industry U.S. Packaging Machinery Report this morning at a press briefing conducted on-site at PACK EXPO International and Pharma EXPO 2016.<br /><br />PMMI produces the State of the Industry study based on U.S. Census Bureau reports and shipments data provided by association members who manufacture packaging machinery. The report, which analyzes 28 packaging machinery categories, describes trends and the outlook for packaging machinery shipments through 2020.</p>
<p>According to the report, the labeling, decorating and coding and case handling machinery groups are forecast to increase the fastest of all machinery types through 2020, at CAGRs of 3.9 percent and 2.5 percent respectively. The pharmaceutical sector is forecast to grow the fastest of all sectors through 2020, at a CAGR of 2.8 percent. This is followed by the beverage sector, which is forecast to grow at a CAGR of 2.4 percent.<br /><br />&#8220;The forecast for the packaging machinery market is strong. We continue to anticipate growth in major market segments such as pharmaceutical as well as beverage. Factors such as changing consumer habits, new regulations as well as general economic development are fueling this development,&#8221; says Jorge Izquierdo, vice president, Market Development, PMMI.</p>
<p>In regards to machinery categories, the rapid growth anticipated in the labeling, decorating and case handling segment is largely a result of new legislation demanding increased labeling and coding, continuing developments in printing technologies and the proliferation of SKUs.</p>
<p>PMMI&#8217;s PACK EXPO portfolio of trade shows continuously brings opportunities for the packaging machinery industry to help support and grow the industry. PACK EXPO East 2017, returning to Philadelphia (Feb. 27&#8211;Mar. 1, Pennsylvania Convention Center) will bring together suppliers of packaging innovations for food, beverage, pharmaceutical/medical device, cosmetic/personal care, chemical/household and other packaged goods that serve companies of all sizes. With one-third of the nation&#8217;s consumer packaged goods companies located within 200 miles of Philadelphia, PMMI is expecting another top-tier event for the growing industry.</p>
<p>Next year will also see the addition of&#160;<a href=""http://www.profoodtech.com/"">ProFood Tech</a>&#160;(April 4&#8211;6, 2017, McCormick Place, Chicago), the most comprehensive food and beverage show in North America, transcending market sectors and showcasing cutting-edge technologies and innovation solutions.

<p>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE</p>
<h3><strong>Pharma EXPO Conference and Innovation Stage Shoot to Solve Top Industry Challenges</strong></h3>
<p><em>The Pharma EXPO Conference and Innovation Stage focus&#160;</em><em>on potentially life-saving solutions for anti-counterfeiting, efficiency and flexibility and patient safety</em></p>
<p><strong>Reston, Va.; Oct. 20, 2016</strong> &#8212; <a href=""http://www.pharmaexpo.com/""><strong>Pharma EXPO 2016</strong></a> (Nov. 6&#8211;9; McCormick Place, Chicago), co-located with <a href=""http://www.packexpointernational.com/""><strong>PACK EXPO International</strong></a> will provide two educational platforms to address key trends and issues along the pharmaceutical supply chain. The show, produced by PMMI, The Association for Packaging and Processing Technologies, will feature a dedicated Innovation Stage as well as the Pharma EXPO Conference Program organized by the International Society of Pharmaceutical Engineering (ISPE). Each will address the latest technologies and practices in combating counterfeit drugs, packaging for patient safety and enhancing efficiency and flexibility. <br /> <br />According to the soon-to-be released 2016 Brand Protection and Product Traceability Market Research Report and <a href=""http://pmmi.files.cms-plus.com/PEI/2016/PMMI_Infographic_Brand%20Protection.pdf"">infographic</a> from PMMI, counterfeiting is increasing three percent per year worldwide. The pharmaceutical segment represents the most valuable part of that market, with $75 billion of revenue derived globally from counterfeit drugs. <br /> <br />To help pharmaceutical manufacturers overcome this challenge, several educational sessions across both platforms will address technologies and practices that combat counterfeiters. These include the Pharma EXPO Conference Program&#8217;s session on smart packaging for pharmaceutical authentication and patient compliance on Wednesday, Nov. 9. Within the topic of anti-counterfeiting measures, serialization will be a core focus. Attendees can choose from a range of sessions addressing technologies and best practices, including the conference&#8217;s dedicated panel presentation and discussion on serialization and compliance on Tuesday, Nov. 8. <br /> <br />Beyond serialization and anti-counterfeiting solutions, the broader subjects of operational efficiency and flexibility are other topics dominating both platforms. Day one of the conference will explore technologies designed to improve efficiency and flexibility in pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical plants. Sessions include explorations of modular and prefabricated cleanroom structures, single-use filling systems and leveraging the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). <br /> <br />Last but not least, packaging for patient safety is also an important theme running through both the conference and Innovation Stage programming. A conference session on Wednesday, Nov. 9 will examine the close inspection of container closure integrity and the Innovation Stage will house presentations on child-resistant and tamper-evident cartons, combating moisture ingress, and ultrasonic sealing of thin-film flexible packaging for the prevention of oxygen transmission. <br /> <br />&#8220;Amid the threats of counterfeit drugs and conditions that create production shortages, advancements in pharmaceutical packaging saves lives,&#8221; said Maria Ferrante, senior director, marketing and communications, PMMI. &#8220;Manufacturers in this industry must stay one step ahead of counterfeiters and regulations at all times, and we are very proud to make Pharma EXPO a hub for the insights they need.&#8221;<br /> <br />The Pharma EXPO Conference Program (Nov. 7&#8211;9) will be held in the West Building (Room W-190A) and will provide a private atmosphere for learning with three topic tracks covering manufacturing operations, compliance trends and pharmaceutical packaging. Each track runs one day of the three-day conference and includes five 50-minute sessions. Designed for the convenience of on-the-go show attendees, the Innovation Stage provides a total of fourteen free, on-floor, half-hour sessions from Nov. 7&#8211;9.<br /> <br />Visit <a href=""http://www.pharmaexpo.com/"">www.pharmaexpo.com</a> to register for Pharma EXPO 2016 and view the full schedule of sessions for the Pharma EXPO Conference Program and the Innovation Stage.

PMMI&#8217;s 2016 State of the Industry Report forecasts U.S. shipments of packaging machinery to reach $8.5 billion in 2020 at a CAGR of 2.4 percent.</p>
<p>&#8220;Growth in packaging is fueled not just by plant expansions, but also by the need to update operations, creating smarter, faster, safer, flexible and more sustainable lines,&#8221; said Jim Pittas, senior vice president, PMMI. &#8220;In a time when stagnating on innovation is bad for business, professionals across a wide range of industries attend PACK EXPO and Pharma EXPO because they know these shows provide the platform for new technologies.&#8221;</p>
<p>The shows offer several guide post destinations, such as The Materials &amp; Containers Pavilion, The Processing Zone, The Reusable Packaging Pavilion, The Food Safety Summit Resource Center and a total of four Innovation Stages offering free on-floor educational sessions, to help attendees find the new solutions and insights they need with greater efficiency. The latest addition to the long list of convenience-enhancing features is the NextGen Networking Fair, taking place in the Education &amp; Workforce Development Pavilion (North Hall, Mezzanine) on Nov. 6 from 3&#8211;5 p.m. The event aims to connect both supplier companies and consumer goods manufacturers with student talent.</p>
<p>In addition to increasing participation and an expanding list of show features, PACK EXPO International and Pharma EXPO 2016, produced in partnership with the International Society of Pharmaceutical Engineering, ISPE, also boast the largest ever Partner Program, with 31 associations and 11 international pavilion organizers from all reaches of the processing and packaging communities. Included are the Contract Packaging Association, the Brazilian Packaging Association, Japan Packaging Machinery Manufacturers, the International Dairy Foods Association and the United Fresh Produce Association &#8211; just to name a few.</p>

The event provides employers in the processing and packaging industry, the opportunity to meet and connect with a targeted audience of talented students from packaging, processing, materials, package design and mechatronics programs.</p>

<p><strong>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE</strong></p>
<h3><strong>PMMI FSMA Update Report Tracks Compliance Progress for Food Companies</strong></h3>
<p><strong><strong>Reston, Va.; Sept. 27, 2016 &#8212;</strong> </strong>While large food companies and OEMs are well on their way towards compliance with the Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA), many food companies are still struggling to understand all aspects of the new law. The latest FSMA Update Report by PMMI, The Association for Packaging and Processing Technologies, analyzes responses from 47 food industry stakeholders on FSMA preparedness and identifies what food manufacturers need from supplier partners.</p>
<p>According to the report, fresh fruit and vegetable processors and small food companies are expected to have the most difficulty with compliance. With only limited regulatory oversight before FSMA, these businesses have been making more investments in new equipment to help meet compliance. Additionally, small food companies and farms are challenged with overhead costs while those that source ingredients from foreign-based suppliers must now ensure that their suppliers comply with the law&#8217;s food supplier program.</p>
<p>The PMMI report notes that many managers still need clarification on deadlines, as well as specifics on what parts of the law are relevant to their facilities. &#8220;Understanding FSMA compliance and documentation requirements present significant challenges to implementation,&#8221; says Jorge Izquierdo, vice president of Market Development at PMMI. &#8220;As a result, about 30 percent of participating companies &#8211; particularly smaller ones &#8211; plan to use OEMs as a consulting resource to help figure out how FSMA applies to their operations.&#8221;</p>
<p>An additional challenge with FSMA is the continuing roll-out of new documentation requirements. Some companies are still awaiting guidance from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Since FSMA is performance-based and does not require specific equipment designs, preparation activities focus mainly on internal staff training on new procedures and protocols, establishing preventive control and instituting more documentation. Drivers for new equipment are mostly business growth and creation of new projects &#8211; but designs and services must address current food safety objectives.</p>

At the Food Safety Summit Resource Center, food professionals will have the opportunity to meet one-on-one with subject matter experts and address a wide range of food safety issues and compliance. Innovation Stage presentations will also cover topics such as &#8220;Promoting Food Safety through Representative Sampling and Hygienic Design&#8221; and &#8220;Secrets that Enable Factory Maintenance to Drive Better Food Safety.&#8221; These Innovation Stage presentations are 30-minute seminars located in the Upper North Building and will take place every half hour throughout the show.</p>

<p>The lounges at PACK EXPO and Pharma EXPO provide meeting rooms, seating, coffee and a chance to recharge away from the show floor.</p>
<p>&#8220;The exhibit halls are always full of activity at our shows,&#8221; says Chuck Yuska, president and CEO, PMMI, &#8220;These lounges give exhibitors and members the chance to take a break and relax, eat, or hold important client meetings. We&#8217;re grateful for Lenze&#8217;s support of this important PACK EXPO show feature.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Being on the show floor is a great way to engage with a large audience of customers, but when it comes to having in-depth business discussions or presenting a proposal, it&#8217;s helpful to have a quiet meeting place,&#8221; explains Susan Duval, marketing manager, Lenze Americas. &#8220;Lenze is happy to sponsor this feature for members and exhibitors.&#8221;</p>
<p>Member lounges (Rooms N-229, N-227B and S-402) will be open on Nov. 6&#8211;9 from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. The member lounge will serve a continental breakfast each morning and provide snacks throughout each day to PMMI member companies.

<p><strong><strong>Food and Beverage Processing Industry Leaders Validate Demand for ProFood Tech&#160;</strong></strong></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><strong>Reston, Va.; July 20, 2016</strong> &#8212; With nine months until its debut, leading international food and beverage corporations are lining up to support the inaugural ProFood Tech (April 4&#8211;6, 2017; McCormick Place, Chicago) powered by PACK EXPO, Anuga and the International Dairy Foods Association (IDFA). PACK EXPO producer PMMI, The Association for Packaging and Processing Technologies, considers the commitments of these influential companies an affirmation of the market&#8217;s need for a comprehensive processing event in North America.</p>
<p>To date, over 113,000 square feet of exhibit space is accounted for by over 270 exhibiting companies, offering innovations in the food and beverage processing industry. GEA, BASF, Duravant, DuPont Nutrition &amp; Health, Key Technology, Meyer Industries and Urschel Laboratories are just a few leading innovators that have signed on to participate.</p>
<p>In June, the ProFood Tech partners convened an advisory council at McCormick Place, made up of representatives from exhibiting companies Tetra Pak, Delkor, Krones, Chr. Hansen, Serac, Azo, Harpak and Deville Technologies. The purpose of the council is to guide the show producers in understanding the most critical trends in the industry, ensuring that ProFood Tech showcases innovations and crossover technologies that will best serve the food and beverage markets.</p>
<p>&#8220;We could not be more pleased with the support we have gotten from companies that are leading the charge in food and beverage processing innovations,&#8221; says PMMI President and CEO Charles D. Yuska, PMMI. &#8220;These endorsements speak volumes about the reputation of the organizations that are partnering to produce ProFood Tech. I know I speak for Anuga and IDFA when I say that we are taking every step to ensure a thorough understanding of the current landscape.&#8221;</p>
<p>With three of the world&#8217;s trade show leaders coming together for one all-inclusive event, the collective expertise of the new biennial event is unparalleled in any other food and beverage processing show and will include a comprehensive education component brought to you by IDFA.</p>
<p>&#8220;There has been a crying need for a truly broad ranging Food Processing Show for many years now,&#8221; says Charlie Harlfinger, CEO of Harpak-ULMA. &#8220;I am confident that the PMMI management team will turn this into a show the industry sorely needs.&#8221;</p>
<p>Carla Fantoni, vice president of communications for Tetra Pak, adds, &#8220;ProFood Tech has the potential to bring the industry together like never before, and we&#8217;re excited to be a part of it. Tetra Pak has extensive global tradeshow experience and we&#8217;re honored to be able to share our insights and support ProFood Tech in becoming a premier event that delivers value to our customers.&#8221;</p>

<h3><strong><strong>New Venue Welcomes Largest EXPO PACK M&#233;xico</strong></strong></h3>
<p><em>Demand for EXPO PACK Guadalajara 2017 exceeds expectations.&#160;</em></p>
<p><strong>Reston, Va.; June 1, 2016</strong> <strong>&#8212;</strong> EXPO PACK M&#233;xico&#8217;s move to Expo Bancomer Santa Fe resulted in the largest show in its 31-year history, growing seven percent from last year, according to show producer, PMMI, The Association for Packaging and Processing Technologies.</p>
<p>The new location allowed the nearly 23,000 attendees to visit almost 1,000 exhibitors over 19,300 net square meters (&#126;208,000 net square feet) of exhibit space. Visitors included prospective buyers from the Mexican States of Puebla, Guanajuato, Estado de M&#233;xico, Queretaro and Morelos, while international attendees came from throughout Latin America, including targeted buying groups from Guatemala, Costa Rica and Colombia.</p>
<p>&#8220;Exhibitors were very pleased with the quality and quantity of attendees this year,&#8221; says Charles D. Yuska, president and CEO, PMMI. &#8220;The success in the new venue speaks to the strength of the EXPO PACK brand.&#8221;</p>
<p>The show once again featured international pavilions from Argentina, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Italy, Spain, Taiwan and U.S. The PMMI Pavilion grew 11 percent from 2015, stretching to 2,379 net square meters (&#126;25,600 net square feet). The largest PMMI Pavilion to date hosted 92 of the 175 PMMI members exhibiting at EXPO PACK M&#233;xico. EXPO PACK M&#233;xico 2016 also saw a second successful year of the Innovation Stage and the seventh year of the EXPO PACK Verde program.</p>
<p>As the Mexican marketplace continues to embrace sustainable processing and packaging options, EXPO PACK M&#233;xico exhibitors in the EXPO PACK Verde program more than doubled with 248 participants.</p>
<p>EXPO PACK M&#233;xico also hosted Packaging Week, organized by the Mexican Association of Packaging (AMEE). AMEE conducted its National Congress, a complete program of conferences and Envase Estelar Awards program. Association partners at EXPO PACK M&#233;xico included AMEE, the National Chamber of Industry Processed Food (CANAINCA), the National Chamber of Industry Graphic Arts (CANAGRAF), the Chamber of Commerce and Tourist Services (CANACO), the National Chamber of the Pharmaceutical Industry (CANIFARMA), the National Chamber of Industry Cosmetic and National Association of Personal Care Products and Home (CANIPEC), and the National Chamber of Metal Containers (CANAFEM).</p>
<p>&#8220;The relationships with our association partners are a testament to EXPO PACK M&#233;xico&#8217;s position as the premier processing and packaging event in Latin America,&#8221; says Yuska.</p>
<p>Gerardo Barajas, director of EXPO PACK, used the opening of EXPO PACK M&#233;xico to reiterate that beginning in 2017, EXPO PACK Guadalajara and EXPO PACK M&#233;xico will alternate years. With the success of EXPO PACK Mexico 2016, exhibitor demand for the first national edition of EXPO PACK Guadalajara (Expo Guadalajara) far exceeded expectations. The 2017 show is on pace to more than double the size of the previous Guadalajara show a full year before the June 13&#8211;15, 2017 dates.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are confident that this strategy will maximize EXPO PACK&#8217;s impact in Mexico&#8217;s two main markets and early booth sales for Guadalajara confirm this,&#8221; says Barajas. &#8220;Suppliers are looking to do business with the many multinational corporations expanding their operations in the Mexican market.&#8221;</p>
<p>His comments supported the findings reported during a special conference session at EXPO PACK M&#233;xico on PMMI&#8217;s newest research, &#8220;Opportunities for Packaging Machinery in the Mexican Market 2016&#8211;2017.&#8221; The study specifically cited strong expected investments from the beverage and food sectors in 2016&#8211;2017, naming Constellation Brands, Coca-Cola, PepsiCo, Nestl&#233;, Mondel&#233;z, Heineken, Mars, Kellogg&#8217;s and Diageo as just some companies who have announced plant expansions or modernization projects.</p>
<p>EXPO PACK M&#233;xico returns to Expo Bancomer Santa Fe, June 5&#8211;8 2018.</p>

<p>PACK EXPO East is the Northeast region&#8217;s most comprehensive event for packaging technologies, making it the premier marketplace for exhibitors to showcase packaging equipment,&#160;machinery&#160;and innovations to a wide range of industries including food and beverage, pharmaceutical/medical device, chemical and personal care.</p>
<p>&#8220;PACK EXPO East delivers everything that has made the PACK EXPO portfolio of shows so strong, connecting exhibitors with customers untapped by the rest of the packaging industry,&#8221; says Chuck Yuska, president and CEO of PACK EXPO producer, PMMI, The Association for Packaging and Processing Technologies. &#8220;After a successful 2015, we are confident the upcoming show in 2017 will provide valuable leads and innovations across the packaging industry.&#8221;</p>
<p>The show&#8217;s accessible location means companies are able to send large buying teams. The Pennsylvania Convention Center stations exhibitors within two hours of 80 percent of the world&#8217;s major pharmaceutical firms and within 200 miles of a third of the nation&#8217;s major CPG retailers.</p>
<p>PACK EXPO East also attracts customers with buying power. In 2015, seven out of 10 attendees had significant or final buying authority, giving exhibitors the chance to meet key decision makers and gain quality leads.</p>

<p><em>PMMI recognizes gains in processing and packaging sustainability.&#160;</em></p>
<p><strong>Reston, Va;&#160;<strong>April 22, 2016</strong></strong>&#160;&#8212; Forty-six years after the first Earth Day, consumer awareness of the environment and their ensuing demand for sustainable products has prompted the processing and packaging industry to respond with sustainable initiatives in operations and packaging. &#160;</p>
<p>The Breaking Down Sustainable Packaging infographic, produced by PMMI, The Association for Packaging and Processing Technologies,&#160; shows how the industry, particularly food and beverage, household and personal care, and healthcare packaging segments are adopting sustainable practices to meet the increased demand of consumers.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re seeing more green options in packaging &#8212; recyclable, reusable and degradable &#8212; as manufacturers reduce source material creating lighter primary and secondary packaging thus reducing waste,&#8221; says Paula Feldman, director of Business Intelligence PMMI. &#8220;We expect this practice to increase in the coming years as CPGs strive to meet consumer demand.&#8221;</p>

<h3>PACK EXPO Int&#8217;l/Pharma EXPO 2016 Lounges Announced</h3>
<p><em>Three show staples for vertical markets all return to PACK EXPO Int&#8217;l/Pharma EXPO 2016</em></p>
<p><strong>Reston, Va.; April 19, 2016 &#8212;</strong>&#160;The Candy Bar Lounge, The Beverage Cooler&#160;Lounge&#160;and the Baking-Snack Break Lounge will all return to <a href=""http://links.pmmimediagroup.mkt4532.com/ctt?kn=1&amp;ms=MTM5NzU2MTMS1&amp;r=MTg3NTkyNzUxNTk0S0&amp;b=0&amp;j=NzQxMTU2MDM2S0&amp;mt=1&amp;rt=0"" target=""_blank"">PACK EXPO International 2016 (McCormick Place, Chicago; Nov. 6&#8211;9)</a>&#160;and the co-located Pharma EXPO, according to show producer PMMI, The Association for Packaging and Processing Technologies.</p>
<p>The National Confectioners Association (NCA) is hosting The Candy Bar Lounge (S-2583) as well as sponsoring The Confectionery Pavilion. The Candy Bar Lounge serves as a networking destination for confectionery industry experts and their customers. &#8220;This lounge allows OEMs and CPGs in the confectionery industry to convene and discuss solutions to challenges the industry might be facing at that time, as well as share the latest innovations specific to confectionery manufacturing,&#8221; says John H. Downs, Jr., president and CEO, NCA.</p>
<p>For the fifth consecutive year, The International Society of Beverage Technologists (ISBT) will host The Beverage Cooler Lounge (N-4575). The Beverage Cooler Lounge, sponsored exclusively by BEUMER Group, will serve as a networking hub for beverage industry professionals and ISBT subject matter experts. &#8220;We are thrilled to be able to host the lounge again at this year&#8217;s PACK EXPO show,&#8221; says Larry Hobbs, executive director of ISBT. &#8220;To be able to provide a dedicated space on the show floor where those in the beverage industry can network and speak face-to-face with ISBT experts about trends, both current and forecasted, is invaluable.&#8221;</p>
<p>PACK EXPO attendees will see The Baking-Snack Break Lounge, hosted by B&amp;CMA (Biscuit &amp; Cracker Manufacturers&#8217; Association) and sponsored by Dorner Manufacturing on the show floor as well. The Baking-Snack Break Lounge (N-4565) will serve as the central meeting place and information center for baking and snack industry professionals at the show. With nearly 15 percent of PACK EXPO&#160; attendees identifying themselves as baking and snack manufacturers, B&amp;CMA President Dave Van Laar knows the importance of this show for the industry. &#8220;The opportunity to, once again, partner with PMMI and PACK EXPO on this lounge is one that we are very excited about,&#8221; says Van Laar. &#8220;PACK EXPO is a valuable event for those in the baking and snack space and by hosting this lounge, we provide those in the industry with a specific place for them to network and discuss the latest industry innovations.&#8221;</p>
<p>These three lounges add to the ever-growing list of networking opportunities for the many vertical markets represented at PACK EXPO and Pharma EXPO. Having industry-specific hubs around the show floor provides unique promotional opportunities, as well as dedicated forums for information exchanges to take place.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is important to provide both OEMs and CPGs the opportunity to network with those specifically in their markets and we are thankful that we get to welcome back the hosts and sponsors for these three lounges,&#8221; says Charles D. Yuska, president and CEO, PMMI. &#8220;It is great&#160;that,&#160;thanks to our established alliances with these premier industry associations, we can offer dedicated spaces that focus solely on these three market segments. Attendees have reported finding great value in having market specific meeting places and we expect these positive experiences to continue.&#8221;</p>
<p>Together PACK EXPO International and Pharma EXPO 2016 are expecting 2,300-plus exhibiting companies, 50,000-plus attendees and over 1.2 net square feet (nsf) of exhibit space.</p>

<p style=""text-align: left;""><strong>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE</strong></p>
<div align=""center"">
<h3 style=""text-align: left;""><strong>U.S. Food Industry Forecast to Grow Through 2022<br /></strong></h3>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><em>Meat and related products and snack food to outperform other segments&#160;</em></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><strong>Reston, Va.; Mar. 18, 2016 &#8212;</strong>&#160;The U.S. food packaging market is forecast to grow at a steady rate of 2.9 percent CAGR through 2022, according to the just released 2016 Food Packaging Trends and Advances report from PMMI, The Association for Packaging and Processing Technologies.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">Based on interviews&#160;from&#160;70 professionals across the food processing and packaging industry in the U.S. and overseas, the study forecasts that meat and related products and snack foods will outperform the market with over 3 percent growth. The growth in these two segments is attributed to consumer demand for portion control and convenience options.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><em><strong>Global Market Growth</strong></em></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">The U.S. food industry trails the global market&#160;and,&#160;while North America is the largest global market across all food segments, the overall growth of the food industry, which includes food packaging, is being driven by emerging markets like Argentina, Brazil, China and India.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">Global growth rates for most segments are double U.S. growth rates, except for meat and related products (8.5 percent), and candy and confections (8 percent), which have higher rates of global growth compared to those of the United States.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><em><strong>Innovation in the U.S. Food Industry</strong></em></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">U.S. food packaging innovations are often concepts that are already in use in other segments and innovations from other countries are beginning to enter the U.S. food packaging market. One trend that meat manufacturers find exciting is a product with a film that opens during cooking which allows the meat to brown after a pre-determined period of time.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">The most innovative food industry segments are:</p>
<ul style=""text-align: left;"">
<li><strong>Snack Foods</strong>: Recycled and biodegradable materials for salty snacks; stylish, vivid graphics and shapes for single-serve packs</li>
<li><strong>Meat and Related Products</strong>: New films to keep meat fresher longer; active labels to sense when meat&#160;is past&#160;its expiration</li>
<li><strong>Fruits and Vegetables</strong>: Clear, tactile films to make consumers pause and consider the product; more single-serve packaging</li>
<li><strong>Pet Food</strong>: More recycled materials in packaging; single-serve containers to differentiate niche or premium products</li>
</ul>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">Consumer demand continues to drive the industry, as noted in the current major packaging trends: convenience, flexibility, safety, sustainability and technology.</p>

<h3><strong><strong>ProFood Tech Exhibit Space Filling Fast</strong></strong></h3>
<p><em>Exhibitor commitments reinforce inaugural exhibition&#8217;s relevance.</em></p>
<p><strong>Reston, Va.; Dec. 15, 2015 &#8212; </strong>Despite being more than 16 months away from the show&#8217;s open, reservations from initial booth selection have already accounted for over 90,000 square feet at ProFood Tech &#8212; more than half of the projected exposition space &#8212; reports PMMI, The Association for Packaging and Processing.</p>
<p>DuPont, Harpak-Ulma, TetraPak, GEA, Ecolab and Pro Mach are among the 180-plus industry leaders who secured their spot.</p>
<p>&#8220;The overwhelming amount of commitments this early on speaks to the industry&#8217;s excitement,&#8221; says PMMI President and CEO Charles D. Yuska, PMMI. &#8220;Companies are enthusiastic about this event, and we already have the numbers to prove it.&#8221;</p>
<p>ProFood Tech, powered by PACK EXPO, Anuga and the International Dairy Foods Association (IDFA), is a new biennial event built to showcase innovations and crossover technologies for food and beverage markets. It will debut April 4&#8211;6, 2017, at McCormick Place, Chicago and will be the most comprehensive processing event in North America.</p>
<p>&#8220;The registration status more than a year prior to ProFood Tech demonstrates the extent to which the industry is longing for a new, international trade fair in the greatly fragmented market of food processing shows in the United States,&#8221; says Gerald B&#246;se, president and chief executive officer of Koelnmesse GmbH. &#8220;This confirms we have set out on the right course together with our strong partners.&#8221;</p>
<p>With the expertise of three of the world&#8217;s trade show leaders coming together for one all-inclusive event, it is no surprise that the industry is responding in such a positive manner, adds Neil Moran, senior vice president of IDFA.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s exciting to see enthusiasm building for the inaugural ProFood Tech,&#8221; says Moran. &#8220;Exhibitors are recognizing the opportunity for new ideas and break-through solutions that can happen when executives from related businesses come together to discuss, review and experience the innovations, products and services available today.&#8221;</p>

<p><strong>Reston, Va.; Dec. 8, 2015 </strong>&#8212; PMMI, The Association for Packaging and Processing Technologies, is proud to announce its&#8217; Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs) 1 Study Guide to help test candidates prepare for the PLC 1 exam.</p>
<p>Part of the Mechatronics Certification Program, the PLC 1 study guide complements the exam, which focuses on computer science technology, and is appropriate as an entry-level exam for industrial maintenance technicians working as PLC specialists, maintenance mechanics, or for those intending to work as multi-skilled mechatronics technicians.</p>
<p>&#8220;This study guide is an excellent resource for test candidates to prepare for the PLCs 1 Exam,&#8221; says Maria Ferrante, vice president, Education and Workforce Development, PMMI, &#8220;The study guide not only provides direction on the competencies covered on the test, it also includes sample questions to enable test candidates to become familiar with the test format.&#8221;</p>
<p>PMMI&#8217;s Mechatronics Certification Tests are based on industry-developed standards and recognized by the U.S. Department of Labor and the Manufacturing Institute&#8217;s Skills Certificate System, part of the National Association of Manufacturers (NAM).</p>
<p>A recent NAM report predicts 2 million of the nearly 3.5 million manufacturing jobs expected to open up over the next decade will go unfilled because of a lack of skilled workers.</p>
<p>&#8220;PMMI is committed to providing members with the tools they need to drive their businesses, and developing a skilled workforce is at the top of this list. The PLCs 1 Study Guide is an additional example of us supporting the manufacturing industry,&#8221; Ferrante adds.</p>
<p>Designed for service technicians and maintenance workers, PMMI&#8217;s Mechatronics Certification helps reduce the time and cost related to technician training. PMMI partners with technical and community colleges across North America to provide the training and education needed to prepare for these tests and ultimately careers in manufacturing. <br /> <br /> To learn more about Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs) 1 and other PMMI Mechatronics Certification Tests as well as the other partner schools that provide training, visit <a href=""http://echo4.bluehornet.com/ct/76642186:7GTp0jCKN:m:1:2695808830:E1398B6C221AFA478287532A1D263D03:r"">pmmi.org/mechatronics</a>.</p>

<h3><strong><strong>Fast Changing Consumer Preferences Create Opportunities for Growth and Innovation </strong></strong></h3>
<p><em>PMMI connects end users and suppliers as they adapt to changing consumer demands&#160;</em></p>
<p><strong>Reston, Va.; Nov. 24, 2015 &#8212; </strong>The impact of changing and diversifying consumer demands were key takeaways from the 2015 State of the Industry: U.S. Packaging Machinery Report, shared by PMMI, The Association for Packaging and Processing Technologies, at PACK EXPO Las Vegas 2015. The study highlighted these shifts toward on-the-go and clean-label products while, more than ever, brand owners must also tackle the challenges associated with a growing variety of consumer preferences. As these companies plan ahead for a successful 2016, PMMI provides an unbroken connection among the processing and packaging communities.<br /> <br /> Continuous collaboration between consumer goods manufacturers (CPGs) and technology suppliers is necessary to speed the implementation of new processing and packaging solutions. The State of the Industry Report noted that &#8220;Improved information on nutrition and growing consumer health consciousness, coupled with increased travel and busy lifestyles, have driven demand for different products. This has led to the growth of indulgent yet healthy foods, convenience foods, different portion sizes (e.g. single-serve packaging), different packaging designs and completely new foods.&#8221; Consumers&#8217; demands are pressing the industry for innovative processing and packaging technologies, and they need them now.<br /> <br /> &#8220;Speed matters,&#8221; says Charles D. Yuska, president and CEO, PMMI. &#8220;As the pressure mounts for CPGs to adapt their operations, immediate access to solutions providers is critical to their success. That&#8217;s why it is our number one priority to connect the makers of goods around the world with the suppliers they rely on.&#8221;<br /> <br /> Evolving consumer demands require faster upgrades in innovation and technology on an industry-wide level. PMMI&#8217;s extensive offerings to address these needs fall into three categories: The PACK EXPO Portfolio of Trade Shows, PMMI Media Group and PMMI Business Drivers, which encompass PMMI&#8217;s collection of market research reports, training opportunities and educational and networking programs. These three pillars bring the continuously changing processing and packaging industries together to address the most recent challenges. <br /> <br /> &#8220;We started this year on the heels of launching PMMI Media Group and continued to see significant growth with the first edition of PACK EXPO East, the announcement of ProFood Tech and the debut of Pharma EXPO in Las Vegas,&#8221; says Yuska. &#8220;We continue to create and nurture spaces in which end users and suppliers can connect, work together in solving tough challenges and keep manufacturing moving forward.&#8221; <br /> <br /> Visit <a href=""http://echo4.bluehornet.com/ct/75686802:71p6n5yAN:m:1:2695808830:BBE613EA38738F64B35E1E68C94914F5:r"">PMMI.org</a> to learn more about the resources and opportunities available through PMMI in the association&#8217;s latest video.<br /> <br /> <strong>About PMMI</strong><br /> <em>PMMI, The Association for Packaging and Processing Technologies, represents the voice of more than 700 North American manufacturers of equipment, components and materials for processing and packaging.

<h3>PMMI Report Finds Flexible Packaging Market Nearing Maturity</h3>
<p><em>One-third of end users expect to increase their use of flexible packaging over the next five years</em></p>
<p><strong>PACK EXPO Las Vegas, Sept. 28, 2015 &#8212;</strong> A new report from PMMI, The Association for Packaging and Processing Technologies, finds that the flexible packaging industry &#8212; projected to reach $32.7 billion in 2015 &#8212; is approaching maturity and can expect to see healthy growth and stability.</p>
<p>The 2015 Flexible Packaging Market Assessment Report draws on in-depth interviews with end users, materials suppliers and other industry experts who weighed in on the future of flexible packaging.</p>
<p>Over two-thirds (68 percent) of end user companies interviewed expect to purchase new equipment, modify existing equipment or buy used equipment to accommodate flexible packaging.</p>
<p>Thirty-three percent of end users expect to increase their use of flexible packaging (vs. rigid materials) over the next five years; however, 61 percent expect the ratio of flexible to rigid packaging to remain the same during that time frame. In this category, 40 percent of the companies use flexible packaging for upwards of 90 percent of their products.</p>
<p>Food products use the most flexible packaging, leading all vertical industries with 57 percent usage of flexible packaging compared to rigid, followed by the pharmaceutical industry at 31 percent. The beverage industry uses 25 percent flexible packaging, while 2 percent of household products are currently in flexible packaging.</p>
<p>The promise of cost reductions and greater strides in sustainability remain significant incentives for consumer goods manufacturers to choose flexible packaging. Downgauging to thinner, lighter packaging reduces the amount of source materials, and flexible packaging's high product-to-package ratio and light weight offer allow more units to fit into a shipment and require fewer shipments for the same amount of product. This reduces shipping costs as well as greenhouse gas emissions.</p>

64,PMMI Report Shows Three Common Threads in Global Packaging Markets,"Consumer trends are impacting packaging markets around the world, according to ""Global Packaging Trends,"" a new report from PMMI, The Association for Packaging and Processing Technologies.","<h3>PMMI Report Shows Three Common Threads in Global Packaging Markets</h3>
<p><em>Health and wellness, recycling and environmental concerns, and the growth of the middle class are making an impact in every region.</em></p>
<p><strong>PACK EXPO Las Vegas, Sept. 28, 2015</strong>&#160;&#8212; Consumer trends are impacting packaging markets around the world, according to ""Global Packaging Trends,"" a new report from PMMI, The Association for Packaging and Processing Technologies.</p>
<p>The report shows three influencers making a mark in every region: growing awareness of health and wellness, recycling and environmental issues, and increasing disposable income and purchasing power.</p>
<p>""These trends are affecting packaging because they're driving consumers' purchasing choices,"" says Jorge Izquierdo, vice president, Market Development, PMMI. ""Recyclability and reusability of packaging are dominant trends and we're predicting that will continue to be seen as PET and glass bottle usage increases.""</p>
<p>Packaging markets in the Middle East and Africa are anticipating 5.3 percent CAGR growth in volume, but forecasts for Western Europe and North America land at the other end of the spectrum, with 0.4 percent and 0.5 percent, respectively.</p>
<p>The expansion in the Middle East and Africa is the result of increasing exposure to modern lifestyles, and is manifesting in growth opportunities available for packaging of carbonates, biscuits, and yogurt and sour milk products. In Asia Pacific, forecast for 4.3 percent CAGR increases in volume, the increasing demand for PET bottles, particularly in the bottled water category, supports health and wellness concerns.</p>
<p>North America, on the other hand, is a mature market, but consumers are developing growing interest in several categories. These include healthy categories such as bottled water, and areas of innovation, such as confectionery.</p>
<p>Globally, the report notes flexible plastic remains the dominant pack type, accounting for 29 percent of the market, while PET bottles (12 percent of the market) will be among the fastest growing, with 4.7 percent CAGR. Bottled water is expected to add 135 billion units through 2019, accounting for 54 percent of the absolute volume growth in PET bottle use. While beverage packaging drives growth in PET and glass, categories such as confectionery and biscuits prop up flexible packaging use.</p>
<p>PMMI, owner and producer of the PACK EXPO portfolio of trade shows, released the results of the study this morning at PACK EXPO Las Vegas and Pharma EXPO 2015. With over 2,000 exhibitors in more than 800,000 net square feet of exhibit space, the co-located shows are welcoming 30,000 attendees to the Las Vegas Convention Center this week.

<p><em>* 2013 data as shown in the 2014 PMMI State of the Industry Study.<br />** Source: U.S. Census Bureau, Packaging Machinery (HS 8422.20 &#8212; 8422.40)</em><br /><br />PMMI, The Association for Processing and Packaging Technologies, produces the State of the Industry Study based on U.S. Census Bureau reports and shipments data provided by association members who manufacture packaging machinery. The report, which analyzes 27 packaging machinery categories, describes trends and the outlook for packaging machinery shipments through 2019.</p>
<p>The largest industry sector for packaging machinery is food, but it&#8217;s not the fastest growing, the study reports. That honor goes to the pharmaceuticals sector, which is forecast to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 2.7 percent to 2019. Behind pharmaceuticals, the forecast for the beverage market is a 2 percent CAGR.</p>
<p>&#8220;This year&#8217;s report also addresses the impacts of outside factors, from legislation to retailers to population growth, on the packaging machinery market,&#8221; says Jorge Izquierdo, vice president, market development, PMMI. &#8220;For example, it points to The Drug Quality and Security Act (DQSA), which created a national regulation for pharmaceutical serialization and track and trace, as the source of the growth we&#8217;re seeing in packaging machinery for the pharmaceutical sector.&#8221;</p>
<p>Within the United States, the value of shipments of packaging machinery grew from $7.1 billion to $7.5 billion from 2013 to 2014. Growth is expected to continue at a 1.6 percent CAGR, reaching $8.1 billion by 2019.</p>
<p>PMMI, which owns and produces the PACK EXPO portfolio of trade shows, released the results of the study this morning in a media briefing at PACK EXPO Las Vegas and Pharma EXPO 2015. With over 2,000 exhibitors in more than 800,000 net square feet of exhibit space, the co-located shows are welcoming 30,000 attendees to the Las Vegas Convention Center this week.

<h3>PLCs 2 Mechatronics Certification Test Identifies Technicians for High-Demand Positions</h3>
<p><em>PMMI will introduce newest nationally portable mechatronics credential at PACK EXPO Las Vegas</em></p>
<p><strong>PACK EXPO Las Vegas, Sept. 28, 2015 &#8212;&#160;</strong>PMMI, The Association for Packaging and Processing Technologies, is introducing its newest Mechatronics Certification Test, &#8220;Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs) 2,&#8221; at PACK EXPO Las Vegas. The nationally portable mechatronics credential will help employers identify workers best qualified for technician positions.</p>
<p>The test covers advanced principles and applications of PLCs and builds on the topics covered on the Programmable Logic Controllers 1 test. Topics include advanced applications of PLCs, industrial network communications, program control, math functions and data handling.</p>
<p>&#8220;Multi-skilled technicians with PLC skills are in high demand,&#8221; says Maria Ferrante, vice president, Education and Workforce Development, PMMI. &#8220;This certification test will help manufacturers identify highly-skilled technicians for the job.&#8221;</p>
<p>PMMI&#8217;s Mechatronics Certification Tests are based on industry-developed standards and recognized by the U.S. Department of Labor and the Manufacturing Institute&#8217;s Skills Certificate System, which is part of the National Association of Manufacturers (NAM).</p>
<p>A recent NAM report predicts 2 million of the nearly 3.5 million manufacturing jobs expected to open up over the next decade will go unfilled because of a lack of skilled workers.</p>
<p>&#8220;PMMI&#8217;s Mechatronics Certification Tests address the skills gap. They&#8217;re critical for manufacturers who are having trouble finding, hiring and developing staff who have the skills needed to troubleshoot, maintain and operate automated equipment,&#8221; Ferrante says, adding, &#8220;PMMI&#8217;s Mechatronics Certification is designed for service technicians and maintenance workers. The tests reduce the time and cost related to technician training. PMMI partners with technical and community colleges across North America to provide the training and education needed to prepare for these tests and ultimately careers in manufacturing.&#8221;</p>
<p>To learn more about &#8220;Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs) 2,&#8221; and the other PMMI Mechatronics Certification Tests as well as the partner schools that can provide training, visit the PMMI team at PMMI&#8217;s booth in the Central Lobby at&#160;<a href=""http://www.packexpolasvegas.com/"">PACK EXPO Las Vegas 2015 (Sept. 28&#8211;30; Las Vegas Convention Center)</a>, the Education and Workforce Development Pavilion in the Upper South Lobby or&#160;<a href=""http://www.pmmi.org/Education/content.cfm?ItemNumber=1010"">pmmi.org/mechatronics</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;Employers will also benefit from the increasing level of confidence they&#8217;ll have in their staff and its ability to move the company forward,&#8221; she says. &#8220;This is a win for everyone involved.&#8221;</p>

<p>More than 35 industry leaders &#8212; including Tetra Pak, GEA Group, Delkor, Sanimatic and Serac &#8212; have committed to exhibit at ProFood Tech since its launch less than two weeks ago, reports PMMI, The Association for Packaging and Processing Technologies. ProFood Tech is a collaboration of three trade show powerhouses: PMMI, producer of PACK EXPO; Koelnmesse, known for Anuga; and the International Dairy Foods Association (IDFA).</p>
<p>Market research revealed a food and beverage industry desire for a comprehensive processing event showcasing crossover technologies from multiple vertical markets &#8212; much like Anuga FoodTec, but in North America. ProFood Tech, projecting 150,000 net square feet of exhibit space and more than 400 exhibiting companies, is built to deliver that experience. The show debuts April 4&#8211;6, 2017, at McCormick Place, Chicago, and will continue biennially, in odd numbered years.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re off to a great start,&#8221; says PMMI Senior Vice President Jim Pittas. &#8220;Exhibiting companies have made it clear they want an event like ProFood Tech, and that they&#8217;re excited by the possibilities the partnership of PMMI, Koelnmesse and IDFA offers.&#8221;</p>
<p>PMMI brings to the table its expertise as North America&#8217;s leading association for processing and packaging, while Koelnmesse provides the proven strength of Anuga, the world&#8217;s largest food and beverage show. IDFA, which represents 85 percent of U.S. dairy manufacturing, will bring its experience with the International Dairy Show, which it will redevelop as a Dairy Pavilion at ProFood Tech. The trio makes ProFood Tech the best place to share food and beverage processing solutions.</p>
<p>&#8220;As a world leader in processing and packaging technologies, Tetra Pak is excited about the potential ProFood Tech holds,&#8221; says Carla Fantoni, vice president of communications for Tetra Pak U.S. and Canada. &#8220;The joint efforts of PACK EXPO, Anuga and IDFA clearly demonstrate a commitment from these three leading organizations to establish a trusted brand serving all food and beverage categories. We think this consolidated approach will help suppliers and customers alike make the most of the show.&#8221;</p>

<p><strong>PACK EXPO Las Vegas Brings the World of Automation Together with the Center for Trends and Technology</strong></p>
<p><strong>Reston, Va.; Sept. 18, 2015 &#8212;&#160;</strong>The drivers and technologies shaping today&#8217;s automated machinery are on display throughout PACK EXPO Las Vegas 2015, owned and produced by PMMI, The Association for Packaging and Processing Technologies. And they are in the spotlight at The Center for Trends and Technology: Improving Production Through Innovation (CTT) (Booth C-4829), sponsored by Rockwell Automation and its PartnerNetwork&#8482; Program.</p>
<p>CTT will feature contributions from five Rockwell Automation PartnerNetwork members: Cisco Systems, Grantek Systems Integration, Interstates Controls, Microsoft and Stone Technologies. They&#8217;ll demonstrate and discuss the connected enterprise working environment, network connectivity, security, remote access, safety, serialization and line integration.</p>
<p>According to Mike Wagner, global OEM business lead, &#8220;Companies adopting a smart manufacturing approach are converging their information technology (IT) and operations technology (OT) systems into a single unified network architecture known as The Connected Enterprise for greater connectivity and information sharing. But The Connected Enterprise is only as powerful as the technology on which it is built. As a result, companies need OEM partners capable of delivering smart machines that accelerate demand-driven manufacturing within The Connected Enterprise.

<h3><strong>Confectionery Manufacturers Find a Sweet Spot at PACK EXPO Las Vegas&#160;</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Reston, Va.; Sept. 16, 2015 &#8212;&#160;</strong>According to research from PMMI, The Association for Packaging and Processing Technologies, consumer wellness concerns, food safety and other health and safety concerns, are among the biggest drivers steering the confectionery industry today (&#8220;Confectionery Trends Market Assessment,&#8221; Sept. 2013).</p>
<p>Confectioners can find a variety of approaches to address these market forces at&#160;<a href=""http://echo4.bluehornet.com/ct/70042692:7_9B6WyNr:m:1:2695808830:C5783FD5587F86ED7EE4D5C5663E8D1B:r"">PACK EXPO Las Vegas 2015 (Las Vegas Convention Center, Sept. 28-30)</a>, owned and produced by PMMI. The show, the largest and most comprehensive of its kind this year, will host 30,000 attendees and over 2,000 exhibitors in more than 800,000 net square feet of exhibit space.</p>
<p>&#8220;In addition to focusing on consumer trends, confectionery professionals need to be up to speed on the Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA), which has changed the way you have to approach food safety during the manufacturing process. PACK EXPO will provide access to suppliers and education that will make compliance easier,&#8221; says Jim Pittas, senior vice president, PMMI.</p>
<p><strong><em>Start at the Beginning</em></strong><br />Confectionery manufacturers can start their trip around the show floor in the Confectionery Pavilion (Upper South Hall), sponsored by the National Confectioners Association (NCA), and then continue over to The Processing Zone. The two pavilions are hubs for the equipment that will help them meet their goals, but confectioners will find even more solutions throughout the exposition halls.</p>
<p>For the latest on food safety issues and Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA) compliance, visit the Food Safety Summit Resource Center (Booth S-7632), also in the Upper South Hall. Organized and brought to PACK EXPO Las Vegas by the Food Safety Summit and co-sponsor GE, the Food Safety Summit Resource Center will be a central location for FSMA experts who will present educational seminars and be available for one-on-one consultations.</p>
<p>The Candy Bar Lounge (Booth S-7900), hosted by the National Confectioners Association (NCA), will be a networking destination for confectionery professionals where NCA industry experts will be available for one-on-one conversations.</p>
<p>&#8220;This lounge is a dedicated area where we can come together to learn the latest innovations and solutions to challenges in the confectionery industry,&#8221; says NCA member John Holland, managing partner, Sollich North America, LLC. &#8220;There is so much value in having this opportunity to talk with those experiencing the same issues as I and sharing insights to overcome those challenges.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Candy Bar Lounge (Booth S-7900) will host a reception on Tuesday, Sept. 29, from 3:30 p.m. to 5 p.m. The event offers confectionery industry attendees networking time with subject matter experts and their professional peers beyond regular show floor hours.</p>
<p>In the Lower South Hall, The Brand Zone features materials and containers that shape winning brands and is a central point for attendees looking to improve product freshness or shelf appeal. Within The Brand Zone, the Showcase of Packaging Innovations&#174;, sponsored by The Dow Chemical Company, will display award-winning packages from competitions around the world.</p>
<p><em><strong>Feed the Mind with Educational Opportunities</strong></em><br />There are plenty of opportunities to learn, too. The Center for Trends and Technology (Booth C-4829), organized by Rockwell Automation and its PartnerNetwork&#8482;, covers the newest in automation technology with displays and educational sessions. The PACK EXPO Innovation Stages (Booths C-1041, C-1045, C-1049) and the Food Safety Summit Resource Center will present even more educational sessions, including these:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><em>The Latest Snacking Trends and Their Impact on Packaging&#160;</em></strong>Presented by Aaron Wallander, Bemis North America (Monday, Sept. 28; 2&#8211;2:30; Booth C-1049)</li>
<li><em><strong>Total Cost of Ownership: One Voice Guidelines for CPGs and OEMs</strong></em>&#160;Presented by Madinah Allen, Snyder&#8217;s-Lance, Inc., and Mark Ruberg, Pro Mach (Tuesday, Sept. 29; 10&#8211;10:30 a.m.; Booth C-1041)</li>
<li><em><strong>Advanced Hygienic Design for Food Processing Equipment</strong></em>&#160;Presented by Bill Sutton, Kollmorgen (Tuesday, Sept. 29; 1:15&#8211;1:45 p.m.; Food Safety Summit Resource Center, Booth S-7632)</li>
</ul>
<p><em><strong>Entertaining Success at PACK EXPO Las Vegas&#160;</strong></em><strong><em><br /></em></strong>&#8220;PACK EXPO is all about learning, doing business better and connecting with your industry,&#8221; Pittas says. &#8220;For connections and networking, you&#8217;ve got to go to PACK gives BACK&#8482;. It will be a great time for a great cause.&#8221;</p>
<p>PACK gives BACK is an annual fundraiser and signature PACK EXPO event, and will feature a performance from legendary rock band Chicago. PMMI will donate ticket sale proceeds to the Fisher House Foundation, an organization that provides comfort to the families of wounded military and veterans during their stays in medical facilities, and the Nevada Military Service Alliance, which is building the state&#8217;s first Fisher House in North Las Vegas.</p>
<p>&#8220;With more than 40 vertical markets represented, PACK EXPO Las Vegas is the most comprehensive event of its kind this year. The industry comes here for solutions to their operational challenges, and because there&#8217;s so much breadth to the show, they have the benefit of coming to truly innovative solutions inspired by other industries,&#8221; says Pittas.</p>

<h3><strong>The Cross Pollination of Ideas Becomes Reality at Pharma EXPO 2015</strong></h3>
<p><em>Co-located with PACK EXPO Las Vegas, the year&#8217;s most comprehensive processing and packaging event, and addressing trends and spotlights solutions across industries&#160;</em></p>
<p><strong>Reston, Va.; Sept. 16, 2015 &#8212;&#160;</strong>From small batches to regulatory compliance to sustainability, pharmaceutical manufacturers have plenty to consider.&#160;<a href=""http://echo4.bluehornet.com/ct/70044327:7yZ6pWycN:m:1:2695808830:22245C1444D456F5ECD789BC549C305F:r"">Pharma EXPO 2015 (Las Vegas Convention Center, Sept. 28-30)</a>, co-owned by PMMI, The Association for Packaging and Processing Technologies and the International Society for Pharmaceutical Engineering (ISPE), will present solutions for these and other challenges throughout the pharmaceutical lifecycle.</p>
<p>The show and its co-located partner, PMMI&#8217;s PACK EXPO Las Vegas, will host 30,000 attendees and over 2,000 exhibitors in more than 800,000 net square feet of exhibit space.</p>
<p>&#8220;Pharma EXPO&#8217;s co-location alongside the largest processing and packaging show of the year delivers unmatched access to suppliers and solutions with crossover technologies from industries such as food, beverage and personal care,&#8221; says Jim Pittas, senior vice president, PMMI.</p>
<p><em><strong>Start at the Beginning</strong></em><strong><em><br /></em></strong>Pharma EXPO &#8212; which occupies the North Hall at the Las Vegas Convention Center &#8212; will bring everything from its successful inaugural debut in Chicago to Las Vegas, and the partnership between ISPE and PMMI means excellence will be at the forefront.</p>
<p>Attendees can start at Pharma EXPO Live (Booth N-405), where videos, live interviews, live-demo alerts, social media and more will keep you on top of everything that&#8217;s happening at the show, including the Innovation Stage (Booth N-559) and the Pharma EXPO Conference Program, organized by ISPE.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, Sept. 29, Pharma EXPO Live will host a reception for attendees from 3:30&#8211;5 p.m.</p>
<p><em><strong>Cross the Line</strong></em><br />Attendees should make time to explore PACK EXPO, too, and take advantage of the way ideas from one industry can apply to another.</p>
<p>The Center for Trends and Technology (CTT) (Booth C-4829) investigates smart manufacturing and its role in processing and packaging. With displays and seminars, sponsor Rockwell Automation and its PartnerNetwork&#8482; program present a glimpse of the future of industry. Seminars will cover topics such as compliance, serialization and line optimization. Cisco Systems, Grantek Systems Integration, Interstates Controls, Microsoft and Stone Technologies are Rockwell Automation&#8217;s partners in the PACK EXPO Las Vegas 2015 edition of CTT.</p>
<p>Food safety is another crossover area. Pharmaceutical professionals and food manufacturers have a lot to learn from each other, and at the Food Safety Summit Resource Center (Booth S-7632) common issues such as sanitary equipment design will be topics of conversation. Organized and brought to PACK EXPO Las Vegas by the Food Safety Summit and co-sponsor GE, the Food Safety Summit Resource Center will be a central location where subject matter experts will present educational seminars and be available for one-on-one consultations.</p>
<p>Down in the Lower South Hall, the Brand Zone is your path to market, with materials and containers that shape winning brands. It&#8217;s a central point for attendees looking to improve shelf appeal and explore packaging challenges. Within The Brand Zone, the Showcase of Packaging Innovations&#174;, sponsored by The Dow Chemical Company, will display award-winning packages from competitions around the world.</p>
<p><em><strong>Feed the Mind with Educational Opportunities&#160;</strong></em><strong><em><br /></em></strong>In addition to the Pharma EXPO Conference, The Pharma EXPO and PACK EXPO Innovation Stages (Booths N-559, C-1041, C-1045, C-1049) showcase more than 40 free educational sessions, including these:</p>
<ul>

<p><strong>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE</strong></p>
<h3><strong>International Powerhouses Announce Launch of ProFood Tech&#160;</strong></h3>
<p><strong><em>PMMI, Koelnmesse and IDFA Join Forces to Offer a New North American Food and Beverage Processing Event at Chicago&#8217;s McCormick Place in Spring 2017</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>Reston, Va.; Sept. 14, 2015 &#8212;&#160;</strong>Three trade show leaders joined forces today to announce the launch of ProFood Tech, a new event that will focus on processing technologies serving the food and beverage industry. ProFood Tech will make its debut April 4&#8211;6, 2017, at McCormick Place, in Chicago, Ill.</p>
<p>The event is powered by three of the world&#8217;s trade show leaders &#8212; PMMI, The Association for Packaging and Processing Technologies; Koelnmesse and the International Dairy Foods Association (IDFA). PMMI is the owner and producer of the PACK EXPO portfolio of trade shows and represents North American manufacturers of equipment, components and materials for processing and packaging. Koelnmesse organizes world leading trade shows for food and beverage, such as Anuga and Anuga Food Tec in Cologne, Germany. IDFA is North America&#8217;s largest dairy association, representing more than 85 percent of all North American manufacturing of dairy products.</p>
<p>&#8220;In assessing the current trade show landscape, we saw there was a need for a dedicated event that brings buyers together with leading world-wide manufacturers in the food and beverage industry,&#8221; says Charles D. Yuska, president and CEO, PMMI. &#8220;ProFood Tech provides a venue to share the latest innovations and crossover technologies from multiple vertical markets within the food and beverage industry and will be that one-stop-shop featuring exhibits from both large companies that serve several customer segments and smaller niche companies with focus on more specific needs.&#8221;</p>
<p>Exponential changes in technology are making it hard for food and beverage companies to keep up. ProFood Tech will provide a wide perspective on the food and beverage processing industry as a whole and feature cutting edge solutions to the challenges the industry is facing every day on the plant floor.</p>
<p>More than a trade show, ProFood Tech provides both large and small suppliers the opportunity to build their businesses by breaking into new food and beverage markets, cementing their status as industry leaders and reaching a large group of customers at one event.</p>
<p>&#8220;In a close dialogue with leading technology suppliers from around the globe, we aim to create a market platform in the United States that is tailored to the requirements of domestic and foreign exhibitors and visitors,&#8221; explains Gerald B&#246;se, president and CEO of Koelnmesse. &#8220;Over a period of decades, Koelnmesse has established an excellent reputation world-wide as a trade show organizer, especially in the field of food products and food technology. Examples include the leading international trade fair Anuga, the world&#8217;s biggest and most important trade show for the food industry, as well as related spin-offs around the world.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;ProFood Tech,&#8221; B&#246;se adds, &#8220;marks a further logical step in Koelnmesse&#8217;s strategy aimed at offering expert support to our customers in various target markets in our role as a global service provider.&#8221;</p>
<p>With an expansive show floor and enhanced educational programming led by IDFA, ProFood Tech will attract high-level buyers from every food and beverage sector.</p>
<p>&#8220;The opportunities for new ideas and break-through solutions are amazing when executives from related businesses come together to discuss, review and experience the innovations, products and services available today,&#8221; says Connie Tipton, president and CEO of IDFA. &#8220;IDFA is proud to partner with these trade show leaders and to continue our tradition of bringing industry suppliers, processors and manufacturers together so they can find profitable business solutions, discover new technologies and see the innovations that are abundant in our industry.&#8221;</p>
<p>Industry leaders, including Delkor Systems, Inc., and Tetra Pak, are excited about the opportunities that ProFood Tech will offer.</p>
<p>&#8220;As a longtime member of both IDFA and PMMI, Delkor is very pleased to see the attention and focus that ProFood Tech will bring to the North American food and beverage industry,&#8221; says Dale Andersen, president and CEO of Delkor Systems, Inc. &#8221;Koelnmesse&#8217;s outstanding reputation as a trade show organizer only strengthens this collaboration.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8221;As a world leader in processing and packaging technologies, Tetra Pak is excited about the potential ProFood Tech holds,&#8221; says Carla Fantoni, vice president of communications for Tetra Pak U.S. and Canada. &#8220;The joint efforts of PACK EXPO, Anuga and IDFA clearly demonstrate a commitment from these three leading organizations to establish a trusted brand serving all food and beverage categories. We think this consolidated approach will help suppliers and customers alike make the most of the show.&#8221;</p>
<p>ProFood Tech is a totally unique endeavor with the collaboration of three of the world&#8217;s leading industry organizations, all with ownership of this initiative. The new show will combine the unrivaled experience and recognition of PACK EXPO, Anuga and IDFA to create an event that will be unprecedented in its ability to address all of the issues facing food and beverage processing operations in the North American marketplace like sustainability, improved operations and food safety.</p>

<p><em>Exhibitor Pro Mach will showcase more than 15 new packaging machinery products at its island in the Central Hall&#160;</em></p>

<p>There are a lot of numbers associated with&#160;<a href=""http://www.packexpolasvegas.com/"">PACK EXPO Las Vegas 2015 (Las Vegas Convention Center, Las Vegas; Sept. 28-30)</a>: 30,000 attendees, 800,000 net square feet of exhibit space, 2,000+ exhibitors. Among those exhibitors, Pro Mach (Booth C-3423) adds its own number, bringing 17 new products to the show, according to Pro Mach&#8217;s Vice President, Marketing, John Eklund.</p>
<p>&#8220;We chose PACK EXPO Las Vegas for these product launches because no other show provides the same level of exposure for Pro Mach. We expect to meet high-level buyers from over 40 vertical markets. It&#8217;s an excellent use of our time and resources,&#8221; says Eklund.</p>
<p>Eklund says Pro Mach&#8217;s new solutions range from energy recovery to robotics to remote solution technologies. Attendees can visit any of its more than 20 exhibiting brands &#8212; they&#8217;re adjacent to each other in a large &#8220;island&#8221; set up &#8212; and see how the various Pro Mach brands can handle their products from primary packaging at the front of the packaging line all the way to secondary packaging at the end of the packaging line.</p>
<p>&#8220;Because of the size and scope of PACK EXPO Las Vegas, we&#8217;re able to have over 70 machines on site. Within our island, it&#8217;s easy for us to present our solutions holistically, walking customers between solutions, so they can see complementary technologies in action that can build up to create solutions for their entire packaging line,&#8221; Eklund adds.</p>
<p>Pro Mach&#8217;s approach to exhibiting underscores the power of the cross-pollination of ideas &#8212; a concept that&#8217;s a hallmark of PACK EXPO trade shows. With the co-location of Pharma EXPO, produced in partnership by PMMI and the International Society for Pharmaceutical Engineering (ISPE), PACK EXPO Las Vegas will provide unmatched access to suppliers and solutions with crossover technologies from industries such as food, beverage and personal care.</p>
<p>&#8220;The comprehensive nature of PACK EXPO, its depth and breadth, makes it an ideal place for Pro Mach to exhibit,&#8221; Eklund says. &#8220;It&#8217;s all about delivering solutions to our customers. PACK EXPO makes it easy for attendees to find answers &#8212; and for us to provide them.&#8221;</p>

<p><strong>Flagship PACK EXPO Show Among Fastest-Growing US Trade Shows</strong></p>
<p><strong>Reston, Va.; Aug. 20, 2015 &#8212;&#160;</strong>PACK EXPO International, owned and produced by PMMI, The Association for Packaging and Processing Technologies, has received Trade Show Executive&#8217;s (TSE) coveted &#8220;Fastest 50 Grand Award&#8221; in the &#8220;Fastest Growing Biennial Show [Sheer Numbers]&#8221; category. The 2014 edition of PACK EXPO International, which included Pharma EXPO, increased in size by 75,338 net square feet, 387 exhibitors and 6,363 attendees.</p>
<p>&#8220;PMMI&#8217;s PACK EXPO International ran way ahead of the pack in 2014, growing an impressive five times faster than the average trade show,&#8221; says Darlene Gudea, president of Trade Show Executive Media Group.</p>
<p>TSE also ranked PACK EXPO International as &#8220;37th Fastest-Growing Show of 2014&#8221; in the &#8220;Number of Exhibiting Companies&#8221; category, and honored the show with its Gold 100 Award for its status as one of the largest trade shows of 2014 in net square feet of exhibit space.</p>
<p>The growth of PACK EXPO has been notable throughout its 59-year history. Since PMMI introduced PACK EXPO in 1956, it has evolved from a single show with 136 exhibitors, 5,000 attendees and 43,116 net square feet of exhibit space into a portfolio with more than seven shows in the United States and Mexico. The first of the trade shows, now known as PACK EXPO International, takes place biennially at Chicago&#8217;s McCormick Place, and hosted 48,400 attendees and 2,352 exhibitors in more than 1.2 million net square feet of exhibit space in 2014.</p>
<p>&#8220;PMMI has long been considered a maverick in the trade show industry, with bold ideas ranging from its in-house service contractor to its unique exhibitor package plans. PMMI&#8217;s strong management team, led by [President &amp; CEO] Chuck Yuska, keeps PACK EXPO International thriving with its focus on creating great value for exhibitors and developing programs that make it a must-attend event,&#8221; Gudea says.</p>
<p>PMMI&#8217;s next event, PACK EXPO Las Vegas 2015, takes place Sept. 28&#8211;30 at the Las Vegas Convention Center, and includes the co-located Pharma EXPO. The combined event will welcome more than 2,000 exhibitors and 30,000 attendees in over 800,000 net square feet of exhibit space.</p>

The series of seminars will make up the first day of the world-class conference produced by the International Society of Pharmaceutical Engineering (ISPE). ISPE co-owns Pharma EXPO with PMMI, The Association of Packaging and Processing Technologies, and curates the conference program.</p>
<p>&#8220;Successful manufacturing operations depend on the best technologies, processes and skilled workers,&#8221; said Charles D. Yuska, president and CEO of PMMI, which owns and produces the PACK EXPO portfolio of trade shows. &#8220;The track ISPE has come up with for Monday will provide knowledge attendees need to move closer to that goal. We&#8217;re very pleased ISPE is organizing the conference.&#8221;</p>
<p>As part of the Manufacturing Operations track, five sessions will detail technologies and practices to overcome challenges affecting professionals across the pharmaceutical, nutraceutical, biotech and medical device industries.</p>
<p>Given the importance of workforce development across the manufacturing sector, a wide range of attendees will benefit from the spotlight session, &#8220;Manufacturing Excellence: Empower Employees to Unleash Their Potential in High Performance Work Teams,&#8221; led by Steve Speer, director, Operations, ProPharma Group.</p>
<p>The challenge of maximizing efficiency is another notable theme. The first session, &#8220;Single Use Systems: Explore the Manufacturing Impact from Supplier Qualification to Optimizing Operations,&#8221; led by Jeff Odum, director of operations, IPS-Integrated Project Services, Inc., will address concerns in implementing new single-use system platforms into existing platforms based on traditional, stainless steel technologies.</p>
<p>Making the right asset investment decisions &#8212; or selecting the best possible contract manufacturer &#8212; is also an important factor contributing to a manufacturer&#8217;s overall efficiency. In &#8220;ISO 55000 and OEMs Who Integrate Reliability &amp; Automation in their Designs,&#8221; Mari Getsug, senior consultant, Maintenance &amp; Reliability Services, CAI-Commissioning Agents, Inc., explores the role original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) play in helping manufacturers achieve reliable, successful equipment design in the age of the new ISO 55000 Asset Management standards. ISO 55000 focuses on lifecycle cost and risk-based performance.</p>
<p>Additionally, Kevin Debbs, process specialist, and Christa Myers, associate/lead process engineer, CRB, will guide attendees in a risk assessment exercise to evaluate contract manufacturing organizations for a project in &#8220;Outsourcing Dilemma: Find the Right CMO to Minimize the Risk and Maximize the Quality of Your Brand.&#8221;</p>
<p>In a presentation that marries matters of efficiency and product safety, Elizabeth Rivera, technical services manager, STERIS Corp, will outline a holistic approach to remediate microbial contamination in process equipment in: &#8220;Microbial Contamination: An Audit Approach to Address Contamination in Process Equipment.&#8221;</p>

<p><strong>Reston, Va.; June 18, 2015 &#8212; </strong>The latest manufacturing advances for the pharmaceutical, biopharmaceutical, nutraceutical and medical device industries arrive in Las Vegas this fall at Pharma EXPO, co-located with <a href=""http://echo4.bluehornet.com/ct/63286293:30376686881:m:1:2695808830:5B2EF6866552F68E28B9BC0077989C74:r"">PACK EXPO Las Vegas (Sept. 28&#8211;30, 2015; Las Vegas Convention Center)</a>. Pharma EXPO is produced in partnership by PACK EXPO owner and organizer PMMI, The Association for Packaging and Processing Technologies, and the International Society for Pharmaceutical Engineering (ISPE). Together, the two shows will provide access to 2,000 processing and packaging solutions providers and 30,000 attendees.</p>
<p>&#8220;Co-locating these two shows offers a powerful opportunity to share ideas across industries,&#8221; says Charles D. Yuska, president and CEO of PMMI, owner and producer of the PACK EXPO portfolio of trade shows. &#8220;We&#8217;re delivering the best of both worlds to attendees who need solutions now and in the future.&#8221;</p>
<p>Pharma EXPO itself will feature more than 160 solutions providers addressing the entire pharmaceutical supply chain. The full exhibitor list is on <a href=""http://echo4.bluehornet.com/ct/63286294:30376686881:m:1:2695808830:5B2EF6866552F68E28B9BC0077989C74:r"">Pharmaexpo.com</a>, where visitors can search for technologies that meet their needs.</p>
<p>On site, attendees can expect to see many innovations, such as the XR75 Transdermal Patch Inspection technology by Anritsu (Booth #N-524). This new X-Ray technology is used to inspect patches and is specifically designed for low-density, thin products with full inspection of both product and seal area. Anritsu&#8217;s HD imaging enables excellent contamination detection, virtual weighing and counting detection.</p>
<p>Another new solution slated for display at Pharma EXPO is the Lite-F, an automated filling machine from Groninger USA (Booth #N-711). The Lite-F, part of the Groninger Lite Series, features a two-headed filling unit that can fill up to 2,700 units per hour with a filling range of up to 500 ml. Changeover is quick and easy with this technology, which also features a 12-inch multilingual touchscreen HMI and a sturdy design.</p>
<p>In addition to the variety of new technologies that will be on display, Pharma EXPO will provide educational opportunities to help industry professionals stay ahead of game-changing market trends and regulations. The Innovation Stage at Pharma EXPO (Booth #N-559) will offer free half-hour educational sessions from industry experts, highlighting new technologies and ideas for pharmaceutical and medical device manufacturing.</p>
<p>The show will also feature ISPE&#8217;s world-class conference program, with tracks concentrating on manufacturing operations (Monday, Sept. 28), compliance trends (Tuesday, Sept. 29) and pharmaceutical packaging (Wednesday, Sept. 30).

<h3>EXPO PACK Guadalajara 2015: 40% Larger Than the 2013 Edition</h3>
<p><em>Show grows as exhibitors capitalize on reaching manufacturers in western Mexico</em></p>
<p><strong>Mexico City, Mexico; October 27, 2014 &#8212;</strong> Hundreds of national and international firms are preparing for EXPO PACK Guadalajara 2015 (Expo Guadalajara, March 10&#8211;12), western Mexico&#8217;s premier packaging and processing trade show, produced by PMMI, The Association for Packaging and Processing Technologies. The second edition of EXPO PACK Guadalajara is expected to feature 350 companies exhibiting across 4,500 net square meters (48,000 net square feet). The premier edition of EXPO PACK Guadalajara welcomed more than 300 exhibitors in 3,200 nsm.</p>
<p>Guadalajara and the surrounding region have seen significant growth with companies expanding and investing in their manufacturing operations. Well-known firms such as Sabritas, Gamesa and Botanas Che Che Che (a company currently expanding to the United States) are making significant infrastructure investments in Jalisco. Nestl&#233; has already selected the region as the location for its largest milk production plant in Mexico, which will include sustainable technologies and address demand for 350 million liters of milk per year in the region.</p>
<p>In addition to the food industry, IT and pharmaceutical manufacturing are also key players in Western Mexico. Communication and IT equipment are the region&#8217;s largest exports, leading the nation, holding 69 percent of the marketplace. And, Jalisco ranks second in the country for pharmaceutical production with 123 pharmaceutical manufacturers, according to ProM&#233;xico.</p>
<p>The Western and Central regions of Mexico have been favored by businesses due to the constant growth of their production capacity and their location. The neighboring states of Colima, Guanajuato, an important manufacturing center for the automotive sector, and Aguascalientes are all projecting significant growth in their manufacturing operations.</p>
<p>These factors make Western Mexico a competitive marketplace for innovative packaging and processing solutions manufacturers and a hub for decision-makers serving some of the most thriving industries in the country.</p>
