  # The top-left cell where data area starts (excluding the header, if exists).
  # It should use a spreadsheet representation such as B4, A3, etc. The data
  # area does NOT include the header. If this configuration is missed, the
  # assumption is that the first row contains the table header and the data
  # origin is the first cell of the second row. And that is A2. In this example
  # the data area starts from the second column of the third row.
  origin: A2

  # The row where the header is placed, if any. If this configuration is missed,
  # there's no table header and the spreadsheet columns (A, B, C, ...) will be
  # automatically used as table header. If the table header is on the first row,
  # this configuration should be 1. The header cell values will act as column
  # names. The value of 2 means that the table header is on the second row.
  header_row: 1

  # The list of columns to be returned. Is basically a list of table header cell
  # values, if a header has been defined with header_row:. If there's no table
  # header (i.e. header_row: is missing), it should contain a list/sequence of
  # column letters (A, B, C, ...). If this configuration is missed, all columns
  # that contain data will be be returned (not recommended).

  # The primary key as a list of keys. It's a list of source columns that are
  # composing the primary key. The list is keyed by column name and has the
  # field storage definition as value. If the table have a header (i.e.
  # header_row: is set) the keys will be set as the name of header cells acting
  # as primary index. Otherwise the column letters (A, B, C, ...) can be used.
  # If no keys are defined here, the current row position will be returned as
  # primary key, but in this case, row_index_column: must have a value.
